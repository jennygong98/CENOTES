        <div style="text-align: justify; width:90%; margin: 0 auto;">
            <p> Kauai’s Tunnels Beach offers some of the best snorkeling on earth. Rock cliffs, stunning views, and a coral reef abundant with marine life make it a haven for adventure seekers who enjoy camping, hiking, and exploring caves.</p>  
            <p style="color:gray"> "<strong>Tunnels" refers to the lava tubes that run through the reef and into the ocean. The magnificent lave rocks line the shoreline at Makua Beach.</strong></p>

            <h3> Overview of Makua (Tunnels) Beach </h3>
            <p> Makua (Tunnels) Beach Amenities</p>
            <p> Tunnels Beach has an excellent coral reef that goes up to the shore, coming within a few feet of dry land at low tide. The beautiful beach offers so much for snorkelers or those looking to relax in the sun. </p>
            <p> The reef at Tunnels Beach provides an excellent habitat for sea turtles, often swimming along the reef or resting in small caves. These small caves offer a fantastic place for sea turtles to rest and sleep, so keep an eye out if you choose to snorkel near them! In addition, you can also find many tropical fish swimming around the reef, along with other marine life, such as eels, octopuses, and crabs. </p>
            <p> Tunnels is also known for its shore break, making it one of Kauai's best surf spots. There are two breaks — one at the mouth of the beach and another further out in the water. A third break is located offshore, but only experienced surfers should attempt this one.</p>

            <h3> Directions to Makua (Tunnels) Beach </h3>
            <p>Take HI-route 56 West out of Hanalei for 5 miles. Once you pass mile marker 35 and drive slowly through the residential area, look for "Tunnels" signs as you bear left to Waikanal Rd. Then, look for mile marker 8 Mile, which stands near the two very short dirt roads that lead toward the beach. With limited parking in this area, come early to find a legal spot.</p>

            <h3> Essential Tips for a Makua (Tunnels) Beach Visit</h3>
            <p>Tunnels is too dangerous to swim during the winter when large waves pound the north shore. We recommend arriving early to find a spot. Don't leave it to the last minute if you want a prime location at the beach. But if a short walk doesn’t faze you, park in Ha'ena State Beach Park just past "Tunnels" or in the parking area on Alealea St. near mile marker 8, but it’s a half-mile walk to Tunnels Beach (heading west).</p>

            <h3> Makua (Tunnels) Beach Amenities</h3>
            <p>This beach LACKS any amenities, as it is a residential neighborhood. NO lifeguards here. However, you can access nearby Ha'ena State Park for many facilities. </p>
