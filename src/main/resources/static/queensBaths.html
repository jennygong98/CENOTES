            <p>Queen's Bath is located inside the high-class neighborhood of Princeville. Queen's Bath is a large natural pool that has been carved out of a lava shelf.</p>    
            <p>The ocean acts as its filter, which makes it dangerous to visit during the winter months when the surf is rougher. In fact, Queen's Bath is closed for the winter, starting each year in October. During the winter months, the sign on the locked gate at Queens Bath read as follows: " <strong>NO TRESPASSING WHEN LOCKED DUE TO HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS. VIOLATORS MAY BE CITED, PROSECUTED, AND CHARGED FOR RESCUE OR RECOVERY EXPENSES.</strong>"</p>
            <p>In the summer months, the water is often calmer, and you can see into the pool even without goggles. Small fish and other ocean life enjoy the beauty of Queens Bath, and you will meet them if you decide to take a dip.</p>
            <p>Occasionally the government will close the bath due to dangerous conditions. This location is not without danger, as many people have been swept into the ocean by rogue waves.</p>
            <p>Proceed at your own risk, and DO NOT visit when closed.</p>
